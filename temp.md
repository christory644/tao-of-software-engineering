But what really blew me away was this passage:
Should You Buy This Book?
Like my previous two books, this one is distributed on the read first, buy later principle...
You can freely download the book, read it, and share it... If you find it helpful or useful... or if you simply enjoy reading itâ€”then buy it.
In a world where everything is paywalled, annual subscriptions are charged upfront, and access comes only after paymentâ€”it felt like a breath of fresh air. How confident and generous must one be to trust their readers like this? It says a lot about the author, and even more about the value of the work itself.
Iâ€™m going to keep reading and will be sharing more of my insights soon. If you're curious about LLMs and want something concise yet powerful, this might just be the book to check out. ðŸ’¡
