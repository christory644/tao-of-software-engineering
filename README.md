# The Tao of Software Engineering

_A meditative companion for the journey of coding._

This is the public working draft of **The Tao of Software Engineering**—a book exploring the intersection of timeless wisdom and modern software development.

This project is being written in the open, using Markdown and version control, because the act of building in public reflects the spirit of the book itself: iterative, honest, and quietly collaborative.
