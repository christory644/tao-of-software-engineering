# Pragmatic Bookshelf Book Proposal

Thank you for your interest in writing with us.

What happens next is that you complete the appropriate sections in this
document. We then discuss it among our proposals team. The outcome is
sometimes an immediate "yes," but will only be a definite "no" if we don't
feel we're the right publisher for you. The rest of the time, this document
will be the basis of a discussion between you and us where we work to
better understand your ideas.

We tell you this because we understand that there are a lot of unknowns here
for you and some of these questions will be difficult to answer. This isn't
a test, so just give us your ideas and we can work from there.

## About You

2. For each author: please tell us a little about yourself:

   - Write a third-person bio that tells us who you are and what you do.
     Imagine that this bio will be displayed next to your book on
     [pragprog.com](http://pragprog.com).

Christopher Story is a software engineer, writer, and occasional “dev philosopher” with nearly three decades of coding experience. He has architected SaaS platforms in health-tech, marketing-tech, fintech, gamified coding challenges, and enterprise microservices, all while sharing reflective insights on developer culture with an engaged LinkedIn audience. Blending the calm of Alan Watts with the pragmatism of Uncle Bob, Christopher invites readers to slow down, breathe, and rediscover the human side of software craft.

Tell us about your experience and relation to the topic, including:

## What is This Book About?

1. Imagine you were writing the one or two paragraphs that people would see on
   your book's Amazon page. You'll want to get the essence of the content across
   in a compelling way. What would you write? (Don't worry, we have people
   who'll do the real marketing blurb.)

The Tao of Software Engineering is a quiet conversation around a campfire, part coding companion, part field guide for the developer’s soul. Inspired by the timeless paradoxes of the Tao Te Ching and the reflective narrative of Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, each short chapter offers a meditative lens on a single aspect of software craft: uncertainty, flow, naming, burnout, feedback, and beyond.

Instead of prescribing frameworks or silver bullets, the book invites readers to slow down, question assumptions, and align with the natural currents of change that shape codebases and careers alike. Through vivid anecdotes—midnight debugging sessions, fragile pull-request egos, the quiet joy of a well-named function—it reminds us that beneath every sprint board beats a human heart, seeking meaning in the merge commits.

2. What overall style do you envisage? (building a sample application, cookbook
   style recipes, short exercises, anecdotes from real-life stories, ...)?

The book is structured as reflective essays with real-world anecdotes.
• Each chapter (3+ pages) opens with a quotation, tells a grounded developer story, then draws a philosophical takeaway.
• Short standalone sections (Horizontal rules + ####-headings) encourage “read anywhere” dipping.
• Occasional thought-provoking questions invite quiet self-reflection.

3. When you think of the final book, how thick will it be (inches, mm, or
   rough page count)?

~30 chapters x ~5 book pages each -> 130-175 pages (~45k words)

## Why Is This Book Needed?

Our books are not just a bunch of facts. Instead we want them to take the
reader on a journey where they will come to master some particular topic. So
tell us, in one or two paragraphs each:

1. What will readers be able to do after reading this book that they couldn't
   do before?

After reading, developers will:

- Recognize uncertainty and impermanence as allies, not threats.
- Cultivate beginner’s mind to reduce ego in code reviews.
- Apply flow principles to write clearer, simpler functions.
- Spot the emotional roots of burnout and complexity before they bite.
- Lead teams with calm presence rather than frantic heroics.

2. Who will benefit from this book?

- Mid-career software engineers seeking depth beyond algorithms.
- Senior/lead devs mentoring others and shaping team culture.
- Self-taught coders who feel the “impostor” itch and crave perspective.
- Tech managers looking for humane material to gift their teams.

3. How are these people currently getting information about the subject of
   the book (other books, YouTube, online docs, ...)? In what way will your
   book serve them better?

Most devs glean philosophy from scattered blog rants, Twitter threads, or dense classics like Mythical Man-Month. Few modern books fuse poetic reflection with concrete everyday anecdotes. The Tao of SWE delivers digestible, story-driven wisdom tailor-made for the developer attention span, without losing literary resonance.

## An Outline

This might be the trickiest section. We're not asking you to commit to a
table of contents, but we do want you to think about the structure and the
reader's journey. Every author will start with some kind of plan, and every
author will find that that plan changes as they start writing (and as our
editors get involved). So what's yours? Just give us a list of major headings
and a sentence describing each. There'll probably be from 8 to twelve
sections here. You don't need to include things such as the preface and
bibliography.

Five major sections: The Self, The Code, The Team, The System, The World.
Each section is broken down into chapters that tackle philosophical concepts from the section and developer point of view.

### Draft Table of Contents

I. The Self

1. The Developer Who Knows Nothing — humility as a strategy
2. You Are Not Your Stack — identity detachment
3. Flow Like a Function — wu wei and pure functions
4. Let Go of Cleverness — simplicity beats brilliance
5. Silence Before the Syntax — stillness as problem-solving
6. Burnout Is a Broken Loop — diagnosing runaway recursion of stress

II. The Code 7. The Code That Can Be Understood Is Beautiful 8. Tests Are Gentle Truths 9. Refactoring Is Returning 10. The Best Code Is Boring 11. Comments for Ghosts 12. Naming as a Spiritual Practice

III. The Team 13. Pair Programming with the Universe 14. Pull Requests and Ego Death 15. Feedback Without Fear 16. Wisdom of the Junior 17. Leading Without Forcing 18. The Tao of the Daily Stand-up

IV. The System 19. Architectures Are Temporary Temples 20. Bugs Are Teachers 21. Complexity Hides in Corners 22. Deadlines Do Not Bend Time 23. Rewrite Nothing Until You Understand Everything 24. Systems Reflect the Soul of Their Creators

V. The World 25. Tech Is Not Neutral 26. Software Shapes Civilization 27. The Tao Is Open Source 28. Delete More Than You Ship 29. Scale What Matters 30. The End Is Just a New Branch

## Writing sample

We need to see an example of your writing. If you've written any other
books, please link to them here and, if possible, send us a sample chapter
from somewhere in the middle of your most recent book as a separate
attachment. If you've never written a book but you have written online
tutorials, blog posts, or anything else designed to teach people how to do
something technical, please point us to where we can see those writing
samples ourselves. And if you've never done any sort of public writing
before, that's okay. We may ask you to send us a five-to-seven-page example
draft that might appear somewhere in the middle of your book.
